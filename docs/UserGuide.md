|**GUI**             | The *Graphical User Interface (GUI)* allows program interaction through graphics               |
|**CLI**             | The *Command Line Interface (CLI)* allows program interaction through commands                 |
|**Command**         | An instruction to the program to perform a specific task or operation <br> e.g., `list-p`      |
|**Prefix**          | An indicator used to mark the start of a *Parameter* <br> e.g., `n/` `st/`                     |

### 2.5 Notes about the Command Format
This subsection describes some noteworthy information about the command format that will be useful in guiding you through the [Features](#4-features) section.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add-p n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add-p n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
